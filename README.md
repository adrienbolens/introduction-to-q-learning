# Reinforcement Learning: step-by-step introduction to the Q-learning algorithm


[This jupyter notebook](notebook.ipynb) was used to support a presentation about Q-learning
that I gave on July 3, 2019, in the context of a recurring 'Machine Learning meetup' at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems.

It contains an introduction to the following concepts and algorithms with some interactive python code:

   - Introduction: the multi-armed bandit (exploration vs exploitation) (with implementation in python)

   - Markov decision processes

   - Dynamical programming (with example in python)

   - Monte-Carlo methods

   - TD methods and Q-learning (with cart-pole example in python)
